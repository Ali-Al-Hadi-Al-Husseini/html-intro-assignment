            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.</p>

            <h2>Who Rust Is For</h2>
            <p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let's look at a few of the most important groups.</p>

            <article>

                <h3>Teams of Developers</h2>
                <p>Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program's logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>
                <p>Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>The Rustfmt formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style across developers.</li>
                    <li>The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration for code completion and inline error messages.</li>
             
                </ul>

                <p>By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be productive while writing systems-level code.</p>

                <h3>Students</h2>
                <p>Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer student questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to programming.</p>
