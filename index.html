            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.</p>

            <h2>Who Rust Is For</h2>
                <p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let's look at a few of the most important groups.</p>

                <h3>Teams of Developers</h2>
                <p>Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the programâ€™s logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>
